## Train a Tensorflown Custom Object(Fire and Smoke) Detector with Tensorflow-GPU

This repository is to introduced TensorFlow Object Detection API for training a custom object detector with TensorFlow 2.X versions. 
The steps mentioned mostly follow this [documentation](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#/) As of 31/12/2020 I have worked with Tensorflow 2.3.0 to train a model on Windows 10.

## Prerequisites
CUDA 10.1  <br />
Python 3.7  <br />
OpenCV-Python  <br />
Tensorflow 2.3.0  <br />
